This project is about applying unsupervised deep learning for food industry automation, see UnsupervisedDeepEmbeddingForClusteringAndAnomalyDetection.pdf.

### Abstract
Currently in food industry most quality assurance tasks areperformed manually by workers.  Since most of these tasksinvolve  visual  assessment  they  are  good  candidates  to  beautomated  through  machine  learning.   This  project  investi-gates an unsupervised deep learning approach for clusteringand anomaly detection on images of pork chops.  Clusteringbased on Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Anal-ysis was applied, and modifications to the base algorithm foranomaly detection were implemented.   Clustering approachdid  not  achieve  significant  performance,  2-class  anomalydetector achieved 10% accuracy increase over the naive base-line.   Results suggest that for this problem an unsupervisedapproach is unlikely to achieve comparable performance withsupervised methods.
